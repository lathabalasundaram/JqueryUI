<h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
<div>

<p> <span style=" font-size:1.5 em;font-weight:bold; color:black;">SINGLE-HANDEDLY DESIGNED</span><br>
	I followed to create my website, from the initial planning stage to the final live website, including these steps:<br>
<span style=" font-size:1.5 em;font-weight:bold; color:black;">DEFINE</span><br>
 
My goal was to create an online profile to promote my design work and gain more exposure. <br>
I needed to be able to write articles, display my design work and have people contact me easily.<br>
I also wanted it to be unique and memorable, while representing my personality.<br>

After some initial research, I wrote down a few ideas and elements to include in my portfolio:<br>

My skill set is a mix of both coding and design, and I wanted this to be prominent.<br>
Responsiveness is important to me because I want mobile and tablet users to also have an optimal experience.<br>
I wanted my case studies to tell a story about my design process, rather than just be a gallery of random images without context.<br>
<span style=" font-size:1.5 em;font-weight:bold; color:black;">DESIGN MY BRAND</span><br>
My brand is basically the visual language that describes who i am and that determines how others see you.<br>
 I wanted to convey a clean, sleek and minimal look and feel.<br>
 I kept things quite simple and decided to create a logo mark from my initials, using a minimal black and white palette.<br>
 I sketched some ideas and experimented with typography and letter arrangement before deciding on the final logo.<br>
 <strong>My logo is not an image,no javascript code, just CSS..</strong><br>
 
<span style=" font-size:1.5 em;font-weight:bold; color:black;">SKETCH WIREFRAMES</span><br>
The approach I took to wireframes is simple but effective, which is a pen and sketchbook.<br>
 I first list all of the elements to include on a Web page.<br>
 I then group related elements, before prioritizing these groups according to importance. <br>
 I usually sketch my wireframes with pen and paper, but tried to use a tool named Balsamiq.<br>
Below is a wireframe for my Home page. <br> 
<span><a><img src="images/home_pg.png"></a></span><br> 

  
<span style=" font-size:1.5 em;font-weight:bold; color:black;">DEVELOP</span><br>
Now that my website is planned and all of the image assets are ready to go, itâ€™s time to start coding.<br>
 As a Windows user, I used Notepad++ as my editor.<br>
I usually start from the top of the Web page and build each element one by one.<br>
I solely developed all the pages (home,projects,hobbies and contact) using the HTML5,CSS3,javascript and jquery plugins.<br>
<span style=" font-size:1.5 em;font-weight:bold; color:black;">TEST ACROSS BROWSERS</span><br>
I am sure you are all aware of the importance of testing to ensure that your website renders correctly across relevant browsers.<br>
Rather than leave cross-browser testing until the end, tested the website every now and then during the development process.<br>

<span style=" font-size:1.5 em;font-weight:bold; color:black;">TIME TO LAUNCH</span><br>
So, i have designed, built and tested my new portfolio, and finally ready to launch!<br>
 This is one of those experiences i simply should not miss out on as a designer.<br>
 I had a great time creating my website and learned a lot in the process.<br>
 Sure, there were hurdles along the way, but is not that what makes design so interesting?<br>
 <strong> Experience : </strong><span  > HTML5,DHTML,CSS3,Javascript,JQuery,DOM,Cross Browser implementation handling.</span><br>
 <strong>Process : </strong><span  >SDLC,STLC,OOP</span><br>

<h3>MYCA</h3>
<div>
<p> For this project,as an <strong>Application Developer</strong>, was involved in all the phases of the SDLC process.<br>

During the design phase,i was involved in the prototype development to get the exact layout of pages as expected by the client.<br>
During the development phase, developed Card benefits JSP pages to display the generic features of the card based on the type of the card which gave a good look on the browser.
I was also a core contributor for the management of the images,logo and the content data using the Content Management System of the American Express (CMAX).<br>
During the testing phase,i was involved in solving the defects created by the tester in QC.The issues were mostly due to cross browser compatibility of the HTML and CSS.<br>
 
 On working with this project,i gained working knowledge on HTML,CSS,DHTML,Javascript and JSP concepts and also learnt about the CMS. <br>
 Being a part of a team,it motivated the passion towards the creative design and development.

<h3>TMA</h3>
<div>
<p> 
For this project,as a <strong>Developer</strong>, was involved in all the phases of the SDLC process.<br><br>

During the Analysis phase, gathered the requirements from the client and solely documented using Rational Requisite Pro.<br>
During the design phase,i solely designed the UML diagrams for the project from the requirements using Rational Rose.<br><br>
During the development phase, developed logic for the vehicle allocation from the spatial data using object oriented concepts of JAVA.
I also developed logic for the over speeding of vehicles using object oriented concepts of JAVA.<br><br>

I hand coded HTML,CSS and AJAX scripts for the development of this application to come up in the intranet website of the company.<br><br>
During the testing phase,i was involved in the unit testing of every module of the application.<br><br>
 
 On working with this project,i gained working knowledge on core JAVA concepts and Rational Requisite Pro and Rational Rose(Analysis and Design tools). <br>
